### trackPageView

```ts
applicationInsights.trackPageView(pageView: IPageViewTelemetry, customProperties?: { [key: string]: any })
```

The `IPageViewTelemetry` interface is below:

Parameter | Type | Description
---|---|---
`name?` | string | **Optional**<br>Name of the pageview. Defaults to the document `title`.
`uri?` | string | **Optional**<br>A relative or absolute URL that identifies the page or other item. Defaults to the window location.
`refUri?` | string | **Optional**<br>The URL of the previous page that sent the user to the current page.
`pageType?` | string | **Optional**<br>Page Type string. Describes how you classify this page, e.g. errorPage, formPage, etc.

`pageTags?` | dictionary | **Optional**<br>Property bag to contain an extension to domain properties - extension to Part B


### startTrackPage

```ts
startTrackPage(name?: string)
```

Starts the timer for tracking a page load time. Use this instead of `trackPageView` if you want to control when the page view timer starts and stops, but don't want to calculate the duration yourself. This method doesn't send any telemetry. Call `stopTrackPage` to log the end of the page view and send the event.

Parameter | Type | Description
---|---|---
`name?` | string | **Optional**<br>The name used to identify the page in the portal. Defaults to the document title.

### stopTrackPage

```ts
stopTrackPage(name?: string, url?: string, customProperties?: { [name: string]: any; });
```

Stops the timer that was started by calling `startTrackPage` and sends the pageview load time telemetry with the specified properties and measurements. The duration of the page view will be the time between calling `startTrackPage` and `stopTrackPage`.

Parameter | Type | Description
---|---|---
`name?` | string | **Optional**<br>The name used to identify the page in the portal. Defaults to the document title.
`url?` |  string | **Optional**<br>A relative or absolute URL that identifies the page or similar item. Defaults to the window location.
`customProperties?` | dictionary | **Optional**<br>Map of string to string: Additional data used to [filter pages](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-api-custom-events-metrics/#properties) in the portal. Defaults to empty.

### trackMetric

```ts
trackMetric(metric: IMetricTelemetry, customProperties?: {[name: string]: any})
```

Log a positive numeric value that is not associated with a specific event. Typically used to send regular reports of performance indicators.

To send a single measurement, use just the first two parameters. If you take measurements very frequently, you can reduce the telemetry bandwidth by aggregating multiple measurements and sending the resulting `average` and `sampleCount` at intervals.

`IMetricTelemetry` is described below

Parameter | Type | Description
---|---|---
`name` | string | **Required**<br>A string that identifies the metric. In the portal, you can select metrics for display by name.
`average` | number | **Required**<br>Either a single measurement, or the average of several measurements. Should be >=0 to be correctly displayed.
`sampleCount?` | number | **Optional**<br>Count of measurements represented by the average. Defaults to 1. Should be >=1.
`min?` | number | **Optional**<br>The smallest measurement in the sample. Defaults to the average. Should be >= 0.
`max?` | number | **Optional**<br>The largest measurement in the sample. Defaults to the average. Should be >= 0.
`stdDev?` | number | **Optional**<br>The standard deviation for the sample. Defaults to undefined which is reported as zero (0).

```typescript
appInsights.trackMetric({ name: "my_custom_metric", average: 1.5, sampleCount: 2, min: 1, max: 2, stdDev: 1.0 });
```

### trackException

```ts
trackException(exception: IExceptionTelemtry, customProperties?: {[key: string]: any})
```

Log an exception you have caught. Exceptions caught by the browser are also automatically logged.

`IExceptionTelemetry` is described below

Parameter | Type | Description
---|---|---
`error` | [Error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error) | **Required**<br>Error object
`severityLevel?` | [SeverityLevel (number)](https://github.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-JS/blob/master/JavaScript/JavaScriptSDK.Interfaces/Contracts/Generated/SeverityLevel.ts) | **Optional**<br>Severity of the message, ranging from verbose to critical

By default, uncaught browser exceptions are caught by the SDK and reported to the portal. To disable this behavior, insert the following line in the config section below your instrumentation key:

```ts
{
  instrumentationKey: "your instrumentation key",
  disableExceptionTracking: true
}
```

### trackTrace

```ts
trackTrace(trace: ITraceTelemetry, customProperties?: {[key: string]: any})
```

Log a diagnostic event such as entering or leaving a method.


The `ITraceTelemetry` interface is described below

Parameter | Type | Description
---|---|---
`message` | string | **Required**<br>Diagnostic data. Can be much longer than an event's name.
`severityLevel?` | [SeverityLevel (number)](https://github.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-JS/blob/master/JavaScript/JavaScriptSDK.Interfaces/Contracts/Generated/SeverityLevel.ts) | **Optional**<br>Severity of the message, ranging from verbose to critical

In the portal, you can search on message content and [display individual trackTrace events](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-diagnostic-search/).
(Unlike `trackEvent`, you can't filter on the message content in the portal.)


### trackDependencyData

```ts
trackDependencyData(dependency: IDependencyTelemetry, customProperties?: {[key: string]: any}, systemProperties?: {[key: string]: any})
```

Log a dependency call (for instance: ajax)

The `IDependencyTelemetry` interface is described below

Parameter | Type | Description
---|---|---
`id` | string | **Required**<br>Unique id, this is used by the backend to correlate server requests.
`absoluteUrl` | string | **Required**<br>Absolute url used to make the dependency request
`success` | boolean | **Required**<br>Whether or not the request was successful or not (e.g., `responseCode` in the range 200-299)
`resultCode` | number | **Required**<br>Response code returned by the dependency request (e.g., `200` for a success)
`commandName?` | string| **Optional**<br>Command used to make the dependency request
`duration?` | number | **Optional**<br>Elapsed time of request & reply
`method?` | string | **Optional**<br>Represents request verb (GET, POST, etc.)

### flush

```ts
flush(async?: boolean = true)
```

Immediately send all queued telemetry. By default, it is sent async.

> *Note:* You don't have to use flush, as it is automatically called at an interval and when the user closes the window.

<a name="setAuthenticatedUserContext"></a>
### setAuthenticatedUserContext

```ts
setAuthenticatedUserContext(authenticatedUserId: string, accountId?: string, storeInCookie = false)
```

Set the authenticated user id and the account id. Use this when you have identified a specific signed-in user. Parameters must not contain spaces or ,;=|

The method will only set the `authenticatedUserId` and `accountId` for all events in the current page view. To set them for all events within the whole session, you should either call this method on every page view or set `storeInCookie = true`.

 Parameter | Type |Description
---|---|--
`authenticatedUserId` | string | **Required**<br>An id that uniquely identifies a user of your app. No spaces, comma, semicolon, equals or vertical bar.
`accountId?` | string | **Optional**<br>An optional account id, if your app groups users into accounts. No spaces, comma, semicolon, equals or vertical bar.

In the portal, this will add to the count of authenticated users. Authenticated users provide a more reliable count of the number of real users than the count of anonymous users.

The authenticated user id will be available as part of the context of the telemetry sent to the portal, so that you can filter and search on it. It will also be saved as a cookie and sent to the server, where the server SDK (if installed) will attach it to server telemetry.

### clearAuthenticatedUserContext

```ts
clearAuthenticatedUserContext ()
```

Clears the authenticated user id and the account id from the user context, and clears the associated cookie.


### addTelemetryInitializer

```ts
public addTelemetryInitializer(telemetryInitializer: (item: ITelemetryItem) => boolean | void)
```

Adds a telemetry initializer to the collection. Telemetry initializers will be called one by one, in the order they were added,
before the telemetry item is pushed for sending.
If one of the telemetry initializers returns false or throws an error, then the telemetry item will not be sent.

```ts
interface ITelemetryItem {
    /**
     * Unique name of the telemetry item
     */
    name: string;

    /**
     * Timestamp when item was sent
     */
    timestamp?: Date;

    /**
     * Identifier of the resource that uniquely identifies which resource data is sent to
     */
    instrumentationKey?: string;

    /**
     * System properties with well defined extensions, documentation coming soon
     */
    ctx?: {[key: string]: any};

    /**
     * Part A custom extensions
     */
    tags?: Tags[];

    /**
     * Telemetry type used for part B
     */
    baseType?: string;

    /**
     * Based on schema for part B
     */
    baseData?: { [key: string]: any };

    /**
     * Telemetry data used for Part C
     */
    data?: {
        [key: string]: any;
    },
}
```

### Custom extension

A custom plugin can be loaded by the SDK through config.extensions. All plugins must implement ITelemetryPlugin interface. These provide the capability of inspecting and updating data as it leaves the system, but also provides additional functionality to for one time initialization of extension state and pass in custom configuration through SKU configuration etc.

```ts
interface ITelemetryPlugin {
    /**
    * Call back for telemetry processing before it is sent to next plugin for processing (needs to be invoked by caller)
    */
    processTelemetry: (env: ITelemetryItem) => void;

    /**
    * Extension name
    */
    identifier: string;

    /**
    * Set next extension for telemetry processing
    */
    setNextPlugin: (next: ITelemetryPlugin) => void;

    /**
    * Priority of the extension
    *
    * 1 - 100: customer plugins
    * 100 - 199: reserved for internal plugins.
    * > 200: channel plugins (that implement IChannelControls to send data to an endpoint)
    */
    priority: number;
}
```
